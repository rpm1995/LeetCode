Contribution is easy:
1. Make sure your code is acceptable on the LeetCode platform with a simple select, copy, and paste.  This is using the Python 3 interpreter
2. Select the entire code, including class definitions and function prototype, paste it into a Python file
3. Name the file LeetCodeProblemNumber_Name_Of_The_Problem
4. Commit and Push!

If you go through variations of code, either trying out different approaches or working up from a brute-force solution, comment out all your trials and leave the accepted solutions uncommented on the bottom.  This way, others can see your thought process.
